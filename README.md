🌟 Excited to share my latest project: a sophisticated Screen Capture Web Application with Picture-in-Picture (PiP) mode! 🖥️✨

🚀 This app leverages modern web technologies to enable seamless screen capture and sharing:

📸 Real-time Screen Capture: Capture your entire screen, specific windows, or browser tabs effortlessly.
🖼️ Picture-in-Picture Mode: Keep an eye on your screen capture in a floating window while multitasking.
🌐 Cross-Browser Compatibility: Works on all major desktop web browsers.
🔧 Developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and powered by the WebRTC API for real-time communication. Simple, efficient, and perfect for multitasking. Stay tuned for updates on mobile compatibility!
